#How to Duplicate
A short tutorial on how to use these scripts to duplicate select files onto an SD card.

##How To Duplicate
###Step 1
Insert as many SD cards as desired into this machine.  Remember, all SD cards will be re-partitioned and copied over; so only plug in those SD cards you want edited.
###Step 2
There are two scripts in this repository labeled Rep1_Multi_Dupe.sh and Rep2_Multi_Dupe.sh, these scripts will move either Rep1 or Rep2 SD card files (respectively) onto SD cards.  To invoke, double click the file and select "Run In Terminal".  The first round of duplication will happen automatically.  User input is required for subsequent rounds (typing "yes" will cause another iteraiton, "no" will exit the script.

##How to Add Files
The duplication scripts copy over all files in a specific directory: Replicator_1_Contents for Rep1 and Replicator_2_Contents for Rep2.  Changing these files will change the files that get copied to SD cards.
